# üå≥ Tree Species Prediction using CNN

This project focuses on classifying different species of trees using deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

## üß† Objective

The primary goal is to predict tree species based on image inputs. This project showcases a simple yet effective CNN architecture to distinguish between classes using image data.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset includes images of various tree species. Images are typically preprocessed to a uniform size before being passed to the model.

- Image format: `.jpg`, `.png`
- Classes: e.g., **Neem, Mango, Peepal, Banyan**, etc.
- You can customize the dataset by updating the image folders and labels.

> **Note**: Due to file size limitations, the dataset and trained model (`Week 2_Models.zip`) are stored in a separate branch or external storage. You may request or clone the `large-files` branch for model assets.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The CNN used includes:

- 2D Convolution Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Flatten + Dense Layers
- Softmax output for multi-class classification

### Model files

There are three models which are downloaded with their weights and the zip file is uploaded in drive check it here:

### üîß Sample Layers:
```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
...
model.add(Dense(units=5, activation='softmax'))
